This is a ecommerce dashboard website which enables users to create their own stores and sell designated products. It supports the creation of multiple stores. Additionally, users can create products, which can be added to the store with its corresponding billboard, size, color and category. The products are displayed on a billboard and users can search and filter products based on their preferences.
